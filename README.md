Sharing Apama EPL Code in forms of projects or epl snippets.

Apama is a Complex-Event-Processing (CEP) Platform. CEP allows organizations to immediately respond with timely and relevant actions related to operational, transactional and fraudulent activity- by correlating and analyzing business events across multiple data streams in real-time.

The Apama Event Processing Platform is a complete design and deployment environment for CEP applications. From graphical design tools to research and backtesting utilities, the complex event processing (CEP) platform provides analysts, developers and administrators a full lifecycle design center that is optimized for CEP solutions.

Include a JAVA example that shows/explains how to send events to the Apama correlators, using Java for reading from an Apache log in order to track the user web site interaction, to promote real-time offers among other use cases.

May-2015: New Apama Queries has been release. Queries offers: Scalable event storage, horizontal processing scalability and a graphical interface for business analyst. 

June-2015: Adding an Epl example about how to call R v3.0.2 functions from Apama. So, your EPL code can do call-out to the R statistics tool in order to provide predictive analytics functionality to Apama if needed.
